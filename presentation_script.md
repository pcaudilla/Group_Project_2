Scene 1

Prolonged drought and record-breaking heat have led to an unprecedented number of intense fires in Australia.  Though bushfires are common in their summer (our winter), fire has ravaged around 25 million acres.  

What you are seeing is the combined data from two different satellites: MODIS and VIIRS from September 1st to January 13th.  Points are based on fire brightness and are assigned a confidence factor.  Low confidence was excluded.  

Billions of plants and animals have been affected by the fires.  Whole ecosystems may be permanently changed.

When you all think of the impact of the fires on wildlife, what do you think of?  Kangaroos and koalas.

Today we will be exploring the potential impact of the fires on native plants and animals.

Scene 2

According to australia.com, Kangaroo Island is one of the best places in Australia to see wildlife. The island is 8 miles off the coast of South Australia.

Scene 3

A survey of plants and animals was completed in 1989 on Kangaroo Island. The island supports 1,179 distinct plant taxa. It is an island of many diverse and unique plants.

There are 6 amphibian, 20 reptile, 25 non-marine mammal, and 267 bird species.

Scene 4

A third of Kangaroo Island has been burned by wildfire.  What you are seeing here is Kangaroo island with that same satellite data as a heatmap.  

The following is a story of 4 native species to Kangaroo Island whose habitats are affected by the wildfires.

We included historical observations based on scientific name from the Atlas of Living Australia.  The atlas pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources.  We attempted to get the range maps for species instead of observations, but were unable to get that information in our timeframe.  Observations may be limited and there may be outdated observations.  We suggest that you look at clusters of observations as opposed to individual points.
 

Scene 5

The coastal white mallee was a dominant plant species during the 1989 species survey. Mallee is a term for eucalyptus trees that are multi-stemmed and low growing.

The coastal white mallee grows in dense patches and provides shelter for other native plants.

High intensity and frequent bushfires create conditions favorable to weed invasions when too many mallee are consumed by fire.  Allowing for the establishment of invasive species.

Scene 6

There are approximately 300 species of termite in Australia.  The snouted termite builds dome-shaped mounds that are 1-2.5 feet high, and usually build their domes near eucalyptus trees such as the coastal white mallee.

The database did not have many observations of this species. The points may not reflect their overall distribution on the island.

Scene 7

The Kangaroo Island echidna is a subspecies of the short-beaked echidna. Short-beaked echidnas typically eat termites, as well as other insects.

They are considered an incredibly important species for ecosystem health because they rework the soil through their digging activity.

Echidna "lay" eggs and the egg develops in a small pouch on the mother. When the young echidna hatches, it is called a "puggle". The puggle rides on the mother as she forages for food. Sometimes, if the puggle gets too heavy, the mother will dig a cradle in a termite mound for the puggle to rest in while she forages. Termites provide food and shelter.

Puggles can sometimes be found in the same termite mounds as the eggs and hatchlings of the Rosenberg's monitor.

Scene 8

Termite mounds are critical for the Rosenberg's goanna as females lay their eggs in the mounds (the young dig themselves out).

They are an average of 4.2 feet long, and are the largest native predator on Kangaroo Island. They feed on birds, mammals, many invertebrates, amphibians and other reptiles.

This species was declining on mainland Australia before this wildlife season. Kangaroo Island is/was their last stronghold.

Scene 9

What relationships do you all see?  Do you observe anything of note about this map?
