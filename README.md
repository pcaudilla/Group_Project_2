# Endangered Animal Species' Habitats Affected by the Australian Wildfires

## Project Topic
How are the numerous wildfires in Australia effecting the many native and endangered animals of Australia? Prolonged drought and record-breaking heat have led to an unprecedented number of intense fires in Australia.  Though bushfires are common in their summer (our winter), fire has ravaged around 25 million acres.  

Our project maps regions of endangered species' habitats, with fire data from two different NASA satellites MODIS and VIIRS from September 1st to January 13th overlayed over it. Points are based on fire brightness and are assigned a confidence factor.  Low confidence was excluded.  

Billions of plants and animals have been affected by the fires. Whole ecosystems may be permanently changed. When you all think of the impact of the fires on wildlife, it would usually be kangaroos and koalas that come to mind first. We would like to explore the potential impact of the fires on native plants and other not-so well known animals instead.


## Rationale 
Areas where fire markers overlap habitat points might be of interest to conservationists or people interested in the survival of these species. We intend to include filtering on a leaflet map visualization to tell the story of how one animal's wellbeing affects another. Recognize the importance of whole ecosystem health. If you protect the mallee, if you protect the termite, you protect the echidna, and you protect the goanna.
