# Endangered Animal Species' Habitats Affected by the Australian Wildfires

### Collaborators
Andrew Eckes, Paula Caudilla, Cherie Mosher

## Project Topic

How are the numerous wildfires in Australia effecting the many native and endangered animals of Australia?
Our project will map regions of endangered species' habitats, with fire data overlayed.  We must determine an appropriate timeframe for our fire data. 


## Rationale 

Areas where fire markers overlap habitat polygons might be of interest to conservationists or people interested in the survival of these species. We intend to include filtering on a leaflet map visualization to tell the story.


## Data Sets

Fire data: 
https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#z:3;c:105.4,6.2;d:2020-01-10..2020-01-11

Endangered Species data: 
https://www.iucnredlist.org/
https://www.ala.org.au/


## Project Track & Stack

It will be a combination of using Libraries like plotly or leaflet to build multiple view of our data sources and possibly an interactive dashboard.
