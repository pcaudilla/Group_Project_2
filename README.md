# Native Species' Habitats Affected by the Australian Wildfires

## Project Topic
How are the numerous wildfires in Australia affecting the many native and endangered animals of Australia? Prolonged drought and record-breaking heat have led to an unprecedented number of intense fires in Australia.  Though bushfires are common in their summer (our winter), fire has ravaged around 25 million acres.  

Our project maps regions of species' habitats, with fire data from two different NASA satellites, MODIS and VIIRS, from September 1st to January 13th. Points are based on fire brightness and are assigned a confidence factor.  Low confidence was excluded.  

Billions of plants and animals have been affected by the fires. Whole ecosystems may be permanently changed. When news stories talk about the impact of the fires on wildlife, it is usually about kangaroos and koalas. We would like to explore the potential impact of the fires on native plants and other not-so well known animals instead.


## Rationale 
Areas where fire markers overlap habitat points might be of interest to conservationists or people interested in the survival of these species. We intend to include filtering on a leaflet map visualization to tell the story of how one animal's wellbeing affects another. Recognize the importance of whole ecosystem health. If you protect the mallee, if you protect the termite, you protect the echidna, and you protect the goanna.

## Potential Future Work

This was a great exploration into potential relationships.  Unfortunately, the current datasets are not conducive to much analysis.  Our maps could lead to future monitoring projects (i.e. find places where all four co-occur) and research projects that compare the abilities of these species to return to these locations.

## Project Track & Stack
* Downloaded fire data CSV files (from 1/1/2019 to 1/13/2020)
* Downloaded animal habitat CSV files from Atlas of Living Australia
* Used Storymap library (https://github.com/jakobzhao/storymap)
* Created heatmap for fire data and habitats for each animals, and overlayed one on top of the other 
* Created a website that tells the story and a references page that has links to sources as well as places for donations
